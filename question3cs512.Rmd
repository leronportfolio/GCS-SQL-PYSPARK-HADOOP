What is the average number of "compliment_cute" received by users who have been on Yelp since before 2010, and how does this compare to the average number of "compliment_cute" received by users who joined Yelp after 2010?

```{r}

users_before_2010 <- yelp_data |>
  filter(as.Date(yelping_since) < as.Date("2010-01-01"))
users_after_2010 <- yelp_data |> 
  filter(as.Date(yelping_since) >= as.Date("2010-01-01"))

# Find the average number of compliment_cute for each group
avg_cute_before_2010 <- mean(users_before_2010$compliment_cute, na.rm = TRUE)
avg_cute_after_2010 <- mean(users_after_2010$compliment_cute, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("Average compliment_cute before 2010:", avg_cute_before_2010, "\n")
cat("Average compliment_cute after 2010:", avg_cute_after_2010, "\n")

# Visualization to compare the averages

  avg_cute = c(avg_cute_before_2010, avg_cute_after_2010)

ggplot(df, aes(x = group, y = avg_cute)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FF5733", width = 0.6) +
